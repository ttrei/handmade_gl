* Figure out coordinate systems

  Need to figure out what coordinates I will use and where.

  - World coordinates, to place entities in the game world
  - Screen coordinates, to render the world onto pixel buffer
    Maybe also Sub-screen coordinates, for creating "windows" within the game
  - Model coordinates, to describe an entity
